## Syntax for adding commit messages

Your commit messages have to be in this format:

```
type(category): description [flags]
```

Where `type` is one of the following:

- `build`
- `docs`
- `feat`
- `fix`
- `others`
- `perf`
- `refactor`
- `style`
- `test`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `temp`
  Where `flags` is an optional comma-separated list of one or more of the following (must be surrounded in square brackets):
- `breaking`: alters `type` to be a breaking change
  And `category` can be anything of your choice. If you use a type not found in the list (but it still follows the same format of the message), it'll be grouped under `other`.

## Auto release

- Each push into `qa` branch will produce a beta release
- Each push into `master` branch will produce a prod release

  Take a look at the following files

- [.github/workflows/beta-release.yml](.github/workflows/beta-release.yml)
- [.github/workflows/prod-release.yml](.github/workflows/prod-release.yml)
